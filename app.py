            Q: How often should I work out?
            A: Most people benefit from 3â€“5 sessions per week depending on goals.

            Q: What's a good beginner workout?
            A: Full-body workouts 3 times a week, focusing on compound movements.

            Q: How much protein do I need?
            A: About 1.6â€“2.2 grams per kg of body weight per day.

            Q: Can I train every day?
            A: You can, but itâ€™s important to manage recovery, volume, and sleep.

            Q: Should I bulk or cut first?
            A: If youâ€™re underweight, bulk. If youâ€™re above 20% body fat, cut.

    Symmetriq is a supplementary tool for bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts.

    It is inspired by Leonardo Da Vinciâ€™s *Vitruvian Man* and based on the golden ratio and modern anthropometric science (i.e., bone structure and proportional symmetry).

    Our goal is to promote a **naturally attainable, aesthetically pleasing physique** â€” one that aligns with your unique genetic structure rather than a generalized or unrealistic ideal. Symmetriq aims to:
    
    - Provide clarity in aesthetic training goals
    - Promote body neutrality and discourage body dysmorphia
    - Reinforce that **perfection is personal**

    3. **Product Partnerships**: Promote verified nutrition and training products through sponsorships to help fund development.
    4. **Habit Education**: Offer structured content on healthy workout practices, timing, burnout avoidance, and the dangers of PEDs and steroids.
